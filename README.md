## What is an 'Open Source Brand'?
As Product Of is an open and transparent community, with the intention of being community run and operated, as such the brand needs to reflect this mentality. By working with the community to establish the Brand Foundation, and then allowing the community to use, change and contribute to every aspect of the brand though a version controlled environment the brand should reflect the ideals and motivations of the community at large, while also providing easy to use assets and resources for members to access when needed.

## Brand Foundation
On Mar 4, 2017 Product of SYD held a **User Centered Branding** workshop with 20+ members of the Product Of community. During this session, the following foundations for the Product Of brand were defined:

## How to contribute
Feel free to use a method of contribution you are most comfortable with. If you are new to Git, you can use GitHub to contribute by simply uploading new files to the repository and following the rules below.

When contributing, your pull request will go though the following process:  
• Pull request is flagged with two Brand Administrators  
• Brand Administrators will assess the request against the contribution rules  
• Brand Administrators will approve or deny the request, with a message outlining the decision  
• Pull request will only be merged into the master branch if both Administators approve

[Here](https://github.com/timcruicky/Product_Of/pull/3#pullrequestreview-39966146) is an example of a bad pull request.

### Rule 1: Clear and concise comments
When commiting a change or adding a new file/asset, be sure to give your pull request a title (i.e 'Updated logo colours') along with a detailed description of the changes made (i.e 'Changed the logo colours to comply with WCAG 2.0 AA contrast requirements'). This will ensure a quick and easy approval process

### Rule 2: Align with the brand Feelings, Traits & Persona
When creating a new asset, or updating an old asset, be sure to relate your choices back to the brand Feelings, Traits & Persona. The Brand Administrators will decide if your requested change/addition aligns with the overall brand foundation & direciton.

### Rule 3: Clean master files
When you commit an asset, be sure to upload any master files needed to work on that asset (i.e. if you're commiting an SVG, be sure to upload the .sketch, .ai, etc you used to create that SVG). The master files you upload should have a clean and clear file strucutre (i.e. foldrs, layer names, etc). If you need help with this, download some existing assets from the repository and see how other designers have structured their files.

### Rule 4: Accessibility
You're assets will be checked agaist WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility standards (at a minimum, admins may also check against colour blind accessibility standards, etc). It's important to us that Product Of is accessible and inclusive to all those that wish to interact with it.
